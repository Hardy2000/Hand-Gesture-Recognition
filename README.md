# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
## Media Control Using Hand Gesture Recognition

### First run main.py  file
* You have to select which method you wants to use for hand detection
* Two methods are available now Background Subtraction & Color detection
* After selection of the method place your hand on the webcam to see if the hand detected clearly or not
* In color detection method you have to first detect hand color using trackbar
* In Trackbar set 
  Lower_H : 90 - 96
  Lower_S : 40 - 50
  Lower_V : 60 - 65
  Leave the others as it is. You can see the hand region detected in 'Thresh' Window.
 #### * Important : Color detection method only works when your background have different color than your hand region. If might as wll detect the background or other body parts if placed in front of webcam.
 
 
* In Background subtraction place your hand after 4-5 sec in front of webcam so that program can capture the background first.
* Now play any video file & Use hand to control media
* I have used shortcut keys of a media player, if you are using other media player change the shortcut keys
